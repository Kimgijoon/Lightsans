### Overview
This project is tensorflow implementation for the low-rank decomposed self-attention networks LightSANs.
Particularly, it projects user's historical items into a small constant number of latent interests, and leverages item-to-interest interaction to generate the user history representation.
Besides, the decoupled position encoding is introduced, which expresses the itemsâ€™ sequential relationships much more precisely.
